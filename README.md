# Library Catalog System (Java)

A beginner-friendly Java mini project that allows users to manage a catalog of books through a console interface. This application enables users to add books, view the complete library, and search books by title or author. It uses *file-based storage* (books.txt) to maintain book data between sessions — making it practical for real-world learning and simple deployment.

##  Project Overview

The *Library Catalog System* is a console-based Java program built for educational use or as a mini-project submission. It follows a modular object-oriented design, separating book logic, catalog management, and user interface into different Java classes.

Unlike other examples found online, this project is *100% custom-coded* with user-friendly features like emoji prompts, clear menu-driven input, and structured output formatting. It does not require any frameworks or databases — making it ideal for Java beginners.

##  Key Features

-  Add new books (title, author, ISBN)
-  Display all stored books in a formatted list
-  Search for books by *title*
-  Search for books by *author*
-  File-based data persistence using books.txt
-  Clean user interface with input validation
-  Simple folder structure (no src/ folder)

##  File Structure

LibraryCatalogSystem/
├── Book.java                 # Book class (title, author, isbn)
├── LibraryCatalog.java       # Manages book list and file operations
├── LibraryCatalogSystem.java # Main class with interactive menu
├── books.txt                 # Auto-created file storing book data


>  Note: books.txt is created automatically after adding the first book.

##  Technologies Used

- *Java* (JDK 8 or later)
- File I/O (FileWriter, Scanner)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Console-based user input/output

##  How to Compile and Run

###  Step-by-Step:

1. Make sure all .java files are in the same folder (e.g., LibraryCatalogSystem/).
2. Open terminal or command prompt inside that folder.

3. Compile all Java files:

```bash
javac *.java

Run main program:
java LibraryCatalogSystem

Sample Console output:


Welcome to the Library Catalog System
======= MENU =======
1  Add Book
2  Show All Books
3  Search by Title
4  Search by Author
0  Exit
